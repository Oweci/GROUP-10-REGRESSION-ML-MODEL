# GROUP-10-REGRESSION-ML-MODEL  "Traffic Volume Prediction using Machine Learning"
We are trying to create a ML model that can detect Traffic

GOAL
To develop a predictive model that estimates traffic volume at a junction using data from surrounding intersections and factors like weekday patterns and time.

DATASET
Name:traffic_dataset_with_weekdays.xlsx  
16,128 (after cleaning and adjustments)  
- **Features:**
  - Cross_1, Cross_2, Cross_3, Cross_4, Cross_5 — traffic volumes at nearby intersections  
  - Weekday — day of the week (Monday–Sunday)  
  - Weather — weather conditions indicator  
  - Temperature — temperature readings  
- **Target Variable:** Cross_6 (traffic volume at the target junction)

Machine Learning Models Used
1. **Linear Regression** — baseline model for understanding basic correlations
